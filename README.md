## Description of project

This project was a homework assignment for my BAIS:3300 class, Digital Product Management. For this assignment I needed to create a 4 page web form and style it using bootstrap.

## How your web form conforms to best practices for forms

My web form conforms to best practices by staying short and only asking what is required. User don't want to fill out long surveys and forms, so you will likely get more responses if your survey is short and easy to answer. Within the form, information that is related is also group together. For example, questions about the respondent's home country, town, and state are ordered next to each other on the same page of the form because they all deal with location information.

Additionally, my webform provides assistance to user by providing a pop-up tooltip for the second question on page 1 of the form to further clarify what I want answered for the "My home town is" question. To further assist users, my form also features required fields that will display a message to fill out the field if it is left empty by the user before moving on to the next page. My form also features a single column layout, so users only have to only stare down a straight line to see the next items on the form.

## How your form provides for user accessibility

Currently, my web form doesn't provide a lot of user accessibility. I used H1 and P html elements to help separate headings and paragraph text, which can help users using screen readers jump to different section. My form had no visualizations, so there was no need for alt text to describe a visualization. My form also features color contrast between a white background and black text. However, because of a lack of time I was unable to implement all the accesibility features I wanted. For example, I could've have added ARIA labels to buttons to further aid users using screen readers.
